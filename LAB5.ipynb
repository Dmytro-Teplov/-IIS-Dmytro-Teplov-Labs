            "    *   **Description:** Instead of training from scratch, we initialize the YOLOv8-n model with weights pre-trained on a large, general-purpose dataset (e.g., COCO dataset). This provides the model with strong feature extraction capabilities learned from a vast array of common objects. The top layers (detection head) are then fine-tuned on our specific small dataset, while the backbone layers (feature extractor) are either frozen or fine-tuned with a very low learning rate.\n",

The increased number of images allowed the pre-trained weights to be fine-tuned more effectively on the specific patterns of the target classes.

            "This suggests that for practical applications with constrained data collection resources, investing in comprehensive data augmentation strategies and fine-tuning robust pre-trained models on even a few hundred relevant images can yield highly effective object detection systems. The efficiency of the neural network in learning from limited data is profoundly influenced by how well the available data's diversity is maximized through augmentation, thereby allowing the benefits of transfer learning to be fully realized. This approach is a viable and powerful strategy for deploying deep learning models in data-scarce environments.\n"

The system accepts input data (X), processes it through reasoning and inference using prompt-engineered instructions, and generates predictions (y). The prompts developed in Lab 1.4 were reused here to show both zero-shot and few-shot prediction behaviors. Using Colab Secrets allowed secure integration of the Gemini API without exposing sensitive keys.\n",
        "\n",
        "What worked especially well is that the few-shot prompt successfully leveraged annotated examples from Lab 1.2, improving performance on small data. The modular structure of the notebook clearly reflects the architecture of my thesis pipeline. Possible improvements include incorporating additional evaluation metrics, automating image visualization, and experimenting with different prompt designs for better generalization. Overall, this lab demonstrates that the system can operate as a unified AI agent capable of handling end-to-end tasks with minimal training data.\n"
