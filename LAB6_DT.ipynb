        "\n",
        "In this lab I integrated a vector index (ChromaDB) and semantic embeddings to provide context for the LLM. By retrieving the three most similar (X, y) examples for each new input, the model received concrete annotation examples in the prompt, making its outputs more consistent with dataset conventions and label formatting. In our small experiments RAG produced a higher proportion of exact-match annotations compared with zero-shot prompts, indicating improved reliability when few labeled samples exist. RAG also reduced ambiguous or verbose outputs because the examples provided an explicit template to follow. For visual retrieval tasks it would be better to use image embeddings (CLIP) rather than text captions; that is recommended for future work. To fully quantify improvement in object detection tasks we should compute standard metrics (IoU, mAP) on predicted bounding boxes, and use real dataset images + ground-truth boxes. Finally, persisting the Chroma DB and batching LLM calls will make large-scale RAG experiments more feasible and cost-effective.\n"
